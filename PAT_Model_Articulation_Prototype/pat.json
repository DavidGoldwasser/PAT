When possible the measure will create mulitple load instances of a specific type in the resulting blended space type. This allows the original schedules to be used, and can allow for down stream EE measures on specific internal loads. Design Ventilation Outdoor Air objects will have to be merged into a single object. Will try to maintain the load design type (power, per area, per person) when possible. Need to account for zone multipliers when createding blended internal loads. Also address what happens to daylighting control objets. Original space types will be left in the model, some may still be assigned to spaces not included in the building area.",
