INFO  While this Measure aims to be comprehensive and was tested against a suite of models of actual building designs, there are bound to be situations that it will not handle correctly.  It is your responsibility as a modeler to review the results of this Measure and adjust accordingly.  If you find issues (beyond those listed below), please <a href='https://github.com/NREL/openstudio-standards/issues'>report them here</a>.  Please include a detailed description, the proposed model, and references to the pertinent sections of 90.1, ASHRAE interpretations, or LEED interpretations.
INFO  *** Currently unsupported ***
INFO  Lighting controls (occ/vac sensors) are assumed to already be present in proposed lighting schedules, and will not be added or removed
INFO  Exterior lighting in the baseline model is left as found in proposed
INFO  Optimal start of HVAC systems is not supported
INFO  Skylights are not added to model, but existing skylights are scaled per Appendix G skylight-to-roof areas
INFO  No fan power allowances for MERV filters or ducted supply/return present in proposed model HVAC
INFO  Laboratory-specific ventilation is not handled
INFO  Kitchen ventilation is not handled; exhaust fans left as found in proposed
INFO  Commercial refrigeration equipment is left as found in proposed
INFO  Transformers are not added to the baseline model
INFO  Zone humidity control present in the proposed model HVAC systems is not added to baseline HVAC
INFO  *** Known issues ***

INFO  While this Measure aims to be comprehensive and was tested against a suite of models of actual building designs, there are bound to be situations that it will not handle correctly.  It is your responsibility as a modeler to review the results of this Measure and adjust accordingly.  If you find issues (beyond those listed below), please <a href='https://github.com/NREL/openstudio-standards/issues'>report them here</a>.  Please include a detailed description, the proposed model, and references to the pertinent sections of 90.1, ASHRAE interpretations, or LEED interpretations.
