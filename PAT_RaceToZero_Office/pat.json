Daylighting will only be added to north and south facades. North and south facades can be +/- 30 degrees of north and south. East and west facades will only receive view windows. The daylight sensor's depth in from the wall will typically be the same as the height of the wall that the daylight windows is on. This depth is also what is used to calculate the daylight fraction of the space. In spaces that are non convex, such as an L shaped space, we may not be able to place a sensor, if that happens a warning will be issued.",

Seal all windows and doors with weather strip and fill any air gaps with insulation and caulking to prevent air infiltration.\r\r\r\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\r\r\r\nInstall Revolving Doors on the Inner Door Entrance - Replace the high traffic entrance doors with revolving doors.

This will greatly reduce outside air from infiltrating during periods of time when loading dock doors are open.\r\r\r\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\r\r\r\nIdentify and seal other sources of infiltration ?

Seal all windows and doors with weather strip and fill any air gaps with insulation and caulking to prevent air infiltration.\r\r\r\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\r\r\r\nInstall Revolving Doors on the Inner Door Entrance - Replace the high traffic entrance doors with revolving doors.  This will reduce the air infiltration associated with the doors.  Notice that loading dock doors and handicapped accessible entrances cannot be replaced with revolving doors.\r\r\r\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\r\r\r\nInstall an Air Curtain for the Loading Dock Door - An air curtain should be installed in the entryway of loading dock doors.  This will greatly reduce outside air from infiltrating during periods of time when loading dock doors are open.\r\r\r\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\r\r\r\nIdentify and seal other sources of infiltration ? Look for other uncontrolled infiltration sources and work to air seal.

Seal all windows and doors with weather strip and fill any air gaps with insulation and caulking to prevent air infiltration.\r\r\r\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\r\r\r\nInstall Revolving Doors on the Inner Door Entrance - Replace the high traffic entrance doors with revolving doors.

Notice that loading dock doors and handicapped accessible entrances cannot be replaced with revolving doors.\r\r\r\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\r\r\r\nInstall an Air Curtain for the Loading Dock Door - An air curtain should be installed in the entryway of loading dock doors.  This will greatly reduce outside air from infiltrating during periods of time when loading dock doors are open.\r\r\r\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\r\r\r\nIdentify and seal other sources of infiltration ?

Seal all windows and doors with weather strip and fill any air gaps with insulation and caulking to prevent air infiltration.\r\r\r\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\r\r\r\nInstall Revolving Doors on the Inner Door Entrance - Replace the high traffic entrance doors with revolving doors.  This will reduce the air infiltration associated with the doors.  Notice that loading dock doors and handicapped accessible entrances cannot be replaced with revolving doors.\r\r\r\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\r\r\r\nInstall an Air Curtain for the Loading Dock Door - An air curtain should be installed in the entryway of loading dock doors.  This will greatly reduce outside air from infiltrating during periods of time when loading dock doors are open.\r\r\r\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\r\r\r\nIdentify and seal other sources of infiltration ? Look for other uncontrolled infiltration sources and work to air seal.
